# Pok√©dex

A web application for Pok√©mon trainers who want to research and save their favourite Pok√©mon.

## :thinking: Why I built this

As someone who grew up around with Pok√©mon, I absolutely loved playing the games and they will always hold a special place in my heart (and I still actively play Pok√©mon Go!). I remember using a lot of sites like Serebii and Bulbapedia so I wanted to build a site that would display the Pok√©mon and information but in my own way!
